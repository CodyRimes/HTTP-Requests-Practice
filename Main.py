#Here is a playground where we will try importing a Python library known as "requests" to have
#our local Pycharm IDE able to send out HTTP requests (the protocol most client/server relationships
#on the internet use to talk to each other in the hypertext transfer protocol)
#Those HTTP requests will be used to talk to an API, i.e. someone else's application out there on the internet
#that could be used to provide us some data, or that we could modify/delete/create some data on their server/application
#First we will need to use the "pip install requests" console terminal command in order to import our library into Pycharm
#it to use the library
